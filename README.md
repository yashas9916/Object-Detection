# Object Detection using YOLOv5

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Object Detection using YOLOv5 project! This project utilizes the YOLOv5 model pretrained on the COCO dataset for object detection. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system, and YOLOv5 represents the latest version of this architecture. By leveraging the power of deep learning, this project can identify and locate multiple objects in images with high accuracy and speed.

## Introduction

Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, and YOLOv5 simplifies the process by providing an efficient and accurate solution. This project allows you to perform object detection on your own images or videos using the pretrained YOLOv5 model.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the YOLOv5 repository:

   ```bash
   !pip install torch torchvision torchaudio5
   !git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   !cd yolov5 & pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -U -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Clone this project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-yolov5.git
   ```

5. Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd object-detection-yolov5
   ```

## Usage

The project supports both image and video object detection. Use the following commands to perform detection:

- For image detection:

  ```bash
  python detect_image.py --image_path /path/to/your/image.jpg
  ```

- For video detection:

  ```bash
  python detect_video.py --video_path /path/to/your/video.mp4
  ```

The detected results will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Pretrained Model

The YOLOv5 model pretrained on the COCO dataset is included in the `yolov5` directory. You can leverage this model for object detection out of the box.

## Data

You can use your own images or videos for object detection. Place your data in the `data` directory, and modify the input paths accordingly in the detection scripts.

## Results

The results of the object detection will be saved in the `output` directory. The output includes annotated images or videos with bounding boxes around detected objects.

## Contributing
